Linux Loadable Kernel Module - Rickroll
Description:
This Linux Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) is a playful implementation designed to "Rickroll" users directly from the kernel space. Once this module is loaded, it creates a character device that, when read, outputs a portion of the infamous "Never Gonna Give You Up" lyrics. The device is read-only, so any attempt to write to it will result in a friendly reminder that the device is read-only.

Key Features:

Character Device Creation: The module registers a character device named "rickroll," which can be accessed through /dev/rickroll once loaded.
Rickroll Message: Reading from the device returns the lyrics "never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down..." as a kernel-level Rickroll.
Read-Only Device: The device is strictly read-only, and any write operations return an error, humorously reminding users that itâ€™s not writable.
Kernel Logging: All interactions with the device are logged to the kernel log, including when the device is opened, read from, or closed.
Code Implementation Overview:

Initialization (rickroll_init): Registers the character device with the kernel and logs a success message if the device is successfully registered.
Exit (rickroll_exit): Unregisters the character device upon module removal, ensuring a clean exit.
Open (dev_open): Logs when the device is opened, preparing it for read operations.
Read (dev_read): Outputs the Rickroll lyrics to the user when the device is read.
Write (dev_write): Returns an error and logs a message indicating that the device is read-only.
Release (dev_release): Logs when the device is closed by the user.
Usage:

Compile the Module: Use the provided Makefile to compile the LKM.
Load the Module: Load the module into the kernel using insmod. This will create the /dev/rickroll device file.
Read from the Device: Use cat /dev/rickroll or similar commands to read from the device and receive the Rickroll message.
Attempt to Write: Try writing to the device to receive the read-only error message (for fun!).

Example Commands:
sudo insmod rickroll.ko   # Load the module
cat /dev/rickroll          # Read the Rickroll message
echo "test" > /dev/rickroll  # Attempt to write to the device (will fail)
sudo rmmod rickroll        # Unload the module
